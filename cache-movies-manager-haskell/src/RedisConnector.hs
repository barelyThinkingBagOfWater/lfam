-- connection lost est pas du Ã  la limite des 100k avec redis? If you consume a stream one by one
-- that should go better with Redis as well

-- Connection to the server lost:
   --  In case of a lost connection, command functions throw a ConnectionLostException.
   --  It can only be caught outside of runRedis.
